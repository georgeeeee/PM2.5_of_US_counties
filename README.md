# PM2.5_of_US_counties

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from [Two Decades of Pollution in US](https://github.com/maurosc3ner/uspm25_2000_2018/blob/master/data/pm2.5byCounty.csv)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a US map with counties and it shows the concentration of each county by the shade of color in a specific year.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
